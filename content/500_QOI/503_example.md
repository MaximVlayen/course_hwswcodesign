Here, an example is shown to help you understand how QOI (encoding) works. The data from the 8-by-8 sensor looks like shown below.

![Example image](/img/500/example.png)

## Header

The header is stictly defined:

* The first for bytes are the letters 'q', 'o', 'i', and 'f'. These letters have to be UTF-8 encoded first, which results in **0x716F6966**.
* The width of the image is stored as a 32-bit value: **0x00000008**.
* The height of the image is stored as a 32-bit value: **0x00000008**.
* Depending on whether or not an alpha channel is present, the number of channels is either 3 (for RGB) or 4 (for RGBA). This is stored in a single byte: **0x03**.
* The colorspace is also represented in a single byte: **0x00** for sRGB with linear alpha and 0x01 for an image where all channels are linear.

This makes the encoding of the header equal to<span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: orange"> 0x716F696600000008000000080300 </span>. Now we continue with the second row.

Both the channels and the colorspace fields are puely informative.

## Chunks

At the start, we assume that the previous values of R, G, and B (called **R_d**, **G_d**, and **B_d**) are all 0x0. The previous value for alpha (**A_d**) is 0xFF. The running array (**RA**) of width 64 is initialised on 0x0's. The current longest runs of repeating pixels is also initialised on -1 (**RLE**).

## End marking

The end marker is a fixed 8-byte value: <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: orange"> 0x0000000000000001 </span>.

# Results of the example

The result of the QOI encoding of the image above hence is:

<span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: orange">&nbsp;0x716F696600000008000000080300 0x5AC276 0xC232C230 0xC232C230 0xC232C230 0xC26DC2FE7F7F7F 0xC22EC226 0xC22EC226C22EC226 0xC2 0x0000000000000001&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: orange">&nbsp;716F6966000000080000000803005AC276C232C230C232C230C232C230C26DC2FE7F7F7FC22EC226C22EC226C22EC226C20000000000000001&nbsp;</span>

This encoded result has a total size of **57 bytes**. If all the 64 pixels (8 by 8) would have to be stored in raw data, with an alpha channel, this would result in **256 bytes**. Without an alpha channel, this would result in **192 bytes** which is a reduction of **70%**!!

If we assume that 1 image is to be recorded every 40 ms, this would result in 25 images per second. This is approximately the framerate of video. If the sensor would make **one image every 40 ms**, it also has to be encoded on that speed. In the simulation, as shown below, the encoding of a single image roughly takes 190000 ns. If we *<u>extrapolate</u>* this result, we get: 190000 ns / 64 pixels = 2.97 µs per pixel, and thus a **480p** image would take 640\*480\*3 µs = 307200*3 µs = 912384 µs = **912.4 ms**.

![Image of simulation](/img/500/simulation.png)

**... and this is an extrapolation!!**

It is hard to give a fixed duration for the encoding of single image. An image of 307'200 consecutive white pixels will be done more quickly than 307'200 random pixels.
